Simple division is the ripple adder, which uses full 1-bit adders and concatnates them. The ripple adder needs to
wait for the carry out signal of the previous block, the ripple adder has a delay of O(n)[given a n-bit adder]


Carry-skip adder and carry-select adders have O(âˆšn) delay and use O(n) area thus the importance to create a
hardware function for use in delay optimized applications
