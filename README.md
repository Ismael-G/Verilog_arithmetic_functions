# Verilog_arithmetic_functions

This repository contains arithmetic functions in systemverilog for use in hardware(FPGAs, ASIC, VLSI) development

The logic behind the algorithms is based off research papers and textbooks (cited in detail in README.md for the specific alogrithm

This project is at it's early stages and formal verification has not yet been implemented

Use of these functions is at your own risk

## Addition:

Addition algorithms included are:

32-bit Carry Skip Adder
Carry Select(Bedrij)
Carry look ahead

## Division

Interpolated Look Up Table Division
Newton Raphson Division
Goldschdmit Division

Note: The original idea for this repository is based off a previous internship that had me create certain arithmetic functions. 
The code created here is entirely new and does not pull from my code created at the former company I interned at.
